# Bio and the raison d'etre

## What I am:

* Happily married husband
* Happily married father of 2 + 4 cats
* Software developer
* Interested in the truth, the real truth and nothing but the truth
* A man interested in the deeper truth of spirituality and our relationship with truth

## What I am not:

I don't claim to have full knowledge, and probably ;) never will. It is important to note my field of expertise (software development) and also note my lack of expertise, thought I am willing to learn. What I am NOT is: 

* A mathematician <sup>**</sup>
* A philosopher <sup>**</sup>
* An astrophysicist <sup>**</sup>
* A set theory expert <sup>**</sup>
* Interested in religious assertions that are not based in truth
* Interested in fairy tales that are untrue
* Interested in truth which refuses to acknowledge spirituality in emotions.
* Interested in untruth, or the continuation of falsehood. 

I've reached a point where only the truth will suffice, whichever comfortable or uncomfortable form that takes, and I would welcome you on my journey to find it


<sup>**</sup> Though I will make some claims which may be counter to existing knowledge, I happy to take your opinion on that. The goal here is to reach the truth, but that requires both parties in the debate for truth to be truthful to one self. This can be difficult and I acknowledge that not everyone will always agree. I want to encourage you to engage me in the search for truth

## Raison d'etre

* To document (and expand upon) my understanding of reality, and to use a no-holds-no-limits-barred approach to understanding truth. No topic is off the table as long as the discussion is salient and civil.
* To document my internal monologue and criticism on it for my children, my wife and my family and to deepen their understanding while I undergo my own journey in to the unknown.

To Yolanda, Lexi and Austin. My love, my heart and my life.
