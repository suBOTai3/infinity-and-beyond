# Definitions

Good, well defined and agreed upon definitions form the fundamental building blocks of constructive arguments.

The definitions list below is in alphabetical order, with the exception of infinity, which is first and foremost because everything documented here 

## Conventions
* When a definition is used, but sufficient language lacks or I need a better definition, then a question mark (?) will be placed next to the definition. Comments + PR's are welcome.

## Infinity

The core concept at play in this repo. Everything revolves around this concept. It's hard to accurately define infinity as our words fail to do it justice. There simply is no accurate description of infinity. That is because, by definition, it is infinite. Attempting to reduce that-which-is-infinite to that-which-is-finite, is by that very act, a logic error. You can say the words, but the act is not sufficient, since infinity remains infinite.

I will try to do it justice, even though it is impossible.

The definitions deserves so much detail that it has its own page here

## Observation

Observation is the act of subsetting a larger set. 

In the context of infinity:
Observation is the subsetting of infinity. It is always a subset of at least infinity. 
It may be a subset of a smaller infinity
a manageble chunk of information based on the capabilities of the observer. More capable observers will be able to subset greater subsets of infinity.

## Sets and subsets



### Sets
A set is a collection of finite or non-finite elements. 

### Subsets
Subsets are collections of elements

### Subsetting - verb

Subsetting is used to retrieve specific observable parts (or observably subsets) of a larger set for a particular purpose.
