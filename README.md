# On Infinity and its implications for personal reality

Disclaimer: This is an exposition on my thoughts. Nothing more, nothing less.
 
## Changes

I will be happy to discuss changes via the raising of issues or PR's.
I think this is a constructive way to establish clear thoughts and results.

Please do not:
1. Bother to submit PRs unless you have a good understanding of the field
2. Bring religion into the discussion unless specifically instructed to do so.

## Fair warning
Talking with other people about the definition, topics and discussions related to infinity can make you sound insane. That is not an exaggeration. 

The topic is difficult to verbalise, difficult to conceptualize, and leads to doubt which can severely impact your mental state, to the point of doubting your sanity.

You should carefully evaluate what you believe of reality, what you believe of infinity and then consider my thoughts and ideas.
