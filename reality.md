# Reality

In the context of general infinity, reality is the observations that an observer makes.
 
Reality is made through observation. Reality is not observed. Personal reality is restricted to:

* The capabilities of the observer
* The compute or signaling processing power
* The sensitivity of the 'observational sense'
* The strength of ability to process signals from other actors

Reality is influenced in turn by:

* Ability of the observer to signal - an observer must be able to signal that it is observing. (?) If a cause cannot be initiated, reality cannot be caused.
* The ability to reduce the size of the set being observed (e.g. a person can at minimum observe trillions of atoms, but using different technologies and instruments, can reduce this to a single atom), assisting in the building of a better mental model. But the reality is still personal. It cannot be held by another. A subset of a personal reality can be shared with another, but another cannot hold a reality. To hold a reality means exclusive access to that reality.
* State of the observer (physical + mental + emotional)
* Emergent properties of the observer - e.g the observer must exist for observation to take place, but the quality of the existance determines the ability (?)
    
    
Based on the above criteria, the reality of the observer is:
* limited the observer
* can be signalled to a 2nd observer, but not held by the 2nd observer
* if the 2nd observer attempts to replace the first, the reality of the first would shift or end for the current observer (?), but likely not end permanently (?)
