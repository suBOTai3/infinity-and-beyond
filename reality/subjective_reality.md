# Subjective reality

Reality is what we make of our world, our world view, our context and the way we subset +  interpret those subsets of infinity. To put it in more technical terms, see [uniqueness of observation](../definitions/observation.md#uniqueness-of-observation).

There is an alternative view of this: That reality is objective. That humans have a subjective view, and that reality is objective, and that we can somehow make our views objective.

From a point of view where we talk about observation, considering that [observation is the act of forming a subset](../definitions/observation.md#definition):
 
* Each subset is made by an observer that has unique state (location, frame of mind, time, etc).
* Each subset is interpreted independantly by an observer
* Each subset's interpretation is _different_ based on the state of the observer
* Each observer has a different state (location, frame of mind, time, etc). 
    * Having the exact same state as another observer implies the first observer is the same as the 2nd. The implication is not that they are similar. They are one and the same.
* If 2 observers have the same state, then they will share a reality
* If 2 observers have different state, then their realities will differ

The last point above is the proof of subjective reality. Making use of your senses, you observe a subset of infinity and make it into what you can manage within your capicity. You will treat this as your own reality, which is subjective. IN fact, you are the only entity that can have this collection of observations, therefore it is subjective. It is an [unshareable bounded context](../definitions/readme.md#unshareable-observable-subsets)

Saying that there is an objective reality would amount to saying that there is another observer out there which has the observational prowess to observe all data (read: infinity) and that said observer has declared its reality as the true, objective reality, and ours as subjective at best. Reminder: Reality is not infinity. Reality is what we make of our observations. How we interpret it. We do not have access to infinity. We only have access to reality. Reality is a subset of General Infinity.
