# Subjective reality

Reality is what we make of our world, our world view, our context and the way we subset +  interpret those subsets of infinity.

There is an alternative view of this: That reality is objective. That humans have a subjective view, and that reality is objective, and that we can somehow make our views objective.

From an observational point of view:

[Observation is subjective](../observation/observation.md)

* Each subset is made independantly by an observer
* Each subset is interpreted independantly by an observer
* Each subset's interpretation is different based on the state of the observer independantly by an observer
* Each observer has a different state. 
    * Having the exact same state as another observer implies the first observer is the same as the 2nd. The implication is not that they are similar. They are one and the same.
    * If 2 observers are the same, then they will share a reality
    * If 2 observers have different state, then their realities will differ

* The act of observation is the creation of a subset
