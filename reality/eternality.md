# Eternality ... lol ... is that even a word?

I'm going to attempt to reason my way into saying yes, we are. Happy to take comments. See my email address in the bio.

* We each have a unique set of observations (see [reality](reality.md) and [subjective reality](subjective_reality.md)).
* Our observations has a beginning in time.
* Those observations stop at some point (our deaths)
* The sum total of the observations make up 'me' or 'I'
* The ['me' or 'I' collection](subjective_reality.md) stops existing in a physical body at some point (death).
* The set of observations do not cease. The set still exists. It is locked away in the past.
* The past is a subset of time.
* Time is a subset General infinity


Now here we come full circle:

Let's use a simple set of observable infinite numbers, a circle.

* No one knows the starting point of a circle (unless you pick an arbitrary point)
* No one can tell you the next point on a circle (unless you fix the number points and define a fixed number of points, but from a perspective of a range of numbers from 0-1, you cannot count to the next number)
* We do know that circles exist
* We know that we have access to some of the data. This exists for us because we're able to observe the numbers.

The same applies to General Infinity

* We're unable to access some parts of it
* We're limited in our observational capacity to traverse time.
* If we were able to change that, we would be able to re-introduce the unique set of observations, 'me', into the current reality of the person performing the observation.
* Since this observation of the collection can be made at any time (even after death), our set of observations is not bound by time. Once there is a starting point, it is infinite (not time bound). At any point after the starting point, even before the starting point, if you can traverse infinity, you can re-introduce the set.
