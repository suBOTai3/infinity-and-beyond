# Reality

In the context of general infinity, reality consists of the observations that an observer makes. We have to assume this since reality cannot consist of unobservable subject matter. 
 
* Reality is _made_. 
* Reality is _made_ through observation. 
* Reality is not equal to observation.
* Obvervation of subsets of infinity = reality
    * Reality is subjective
    * Infinity is objective

Personal reality is restricted to:

* The capabilities of the observer
* The compute or signaling processing power
* The sensitivity of the 'observational sense'
* The strength of ability to process signals from other actors or signal senders.

Reality is influenced in turn by:

* Ability of the observer to signal - an observer must be able to signal that it is observing. (?) If a cause cannot be initiated, reality cannot be caused.
* The ability to reduce the size of the set being observed (e.g. a person can at minimum observe trillions of atoms, but using different technologies and instruments, can reduce this to a single atom), assisting in the building of a better mental model. But the reality is still personal. It cannot be held by another. A subset of a personal reality can be shared with another, but another cannot hold a reality. To hold a reality means exclusive access to that reality.
* State of the observer (physical + mental + emotional)
* Emergent properties of the observer - e.g the observer must exist for observation to take place, but the quality of the existance determines the ability to observe (?)
    
    
Based on the above criteria, the reality of the observer is:
* limited the observer
* can be signalled to a 2nd observer, but not held by the 2nd observer
* if the 2nd observer attempts to replace the first, the reality of the first would shift or end for the current observer (?), but likely not end permanently (?)
