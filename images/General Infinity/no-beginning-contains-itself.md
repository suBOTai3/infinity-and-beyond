# No beginnings, but contains itself

This is a difficult concept.

In infinity, a lay person can say 'there is a beginning of infinity'. And we would be right. But the truth is that this is the boundary of our observational capability (See [observation](../../observation.md))

Infinity has no beginning.
But where did infinity come from? 

Well, the answer is - `itself`.

## Scenario: Drawing a circle

You can think of it as a circle.

We think of circles in the way that we draw them.

* I pickup my pencil
* I start at a point {x,y}, let's call it point 1
* I loop my hand clockwise or counter clockwise
* I end at the same point I started
* The circle is now complete
* The circle now exists from my perspective as I'm able to change my view and still see it
* It doesn't disappear

This is the obverved circle. This is a methodology that a constrained being, me, constrained in x number (e.g. 4) of dimensions, is using to define a circle.

* I start placing my pencil at point {1}, coordinates {x},{y} at radius {r}. 
* (spacial constraints force me to start at a single point)
* I move my hand in a clockwise or counter clockwise direction 
* (spacial constraints force me to move in at least 1 direction to complete the circle)
* I end at the point I started
* The circle is now complete
* I have in my mind the start + end points of the circle
* The circle itself contains the start + end points

The important bits here are: 
1. There was an arbitrary starting point which I labelled as (1) and 
2. I ended the circle at the same point, though it is not the exact same point because it has to end just before it
3. The circle contains its own starting point and endpoint

This is a typical scenario. Let's change the scenario up a bit.

## Scenario: Signalling a circle into existance

Let's say I'm no longer required to draw a circle starting from the startpoint. I can put the entire circle down in 1 go. I think it, I imagine it, and it's there. I have the thought in my head and the circle appears on paper.

This is now the observed circle. This is a methodology that an unconstrained being, me, _unconstrained_ in x number (e.g. 4) of dimensions, used to define a circle (Yes - we're getting into gray areas here - stick with me).

Using this approach, I now no longer refer to the circle as having a starting point. Instead, the starting point is wherever I decide it is. So the starting point of the circle is arbitrary.

Previously it was at a specific coordinate {x,y}. This coordinate overlapped with the endpoint of the circle.

However this time around the circle has no predefined start point. 
When I wish to observe a start point, I decide where it is. I will, at the point of making the decision, decide what number to assign to it (point 1) 

The important bits here are: 
1. There is an arbitrary starting point which I labelled as (1) and 
2. The circle ends at the same point, though it is not the exact same point because it has to end just before it
3. The circle contains its own starting point and endpoint

## Takeaway

* In both scenarios, both circles contained a starting point and endpoint
* The start points and end points were semantic values the observer defined to assist with the definition the observer is trying to arrive at.
* In both scenarios, the subset (the circle) contains its own starting point and endpoint
* Even if you remove an arbitrary number of points (but not everything) including the start point and endpoint from the circle, the concept of start and end points are still there and is contained within the circle itself.

This is a somewhat applicable concept, but it is only applicable in 2 dimensions.

This is the concept take away from General infinity, infinite in all dimensions, concepts and time: 
* It contains its own origin. 
* It contains its own end. 
* It contains its own cause
* It contains its own effect
* There is no origin. And there is no end.
* There is no cause that caused it. And there is no effect that result after it ends
* This is because infinity contains everything. Even its own start and end.
* Whatever origin or end we attempt to define is an arbitrary subset of infinity, but not the true starting point or ending point of infinity. 
* It is an attempt by an observer to make sense of infinity by subsetting it into manageble chunks of information.

Side note:  The only possible observation we could make as a starting point would be quanta. 
(See [phsyicality](../../physicality.md)). Quanta, from an observer's perspective, is the starting point, the smallest unit of measure, of infinity.

Another way to phrase this would be: Quanta is our observable starting point of infinity.

If we were to invert that concept: Infinity's entry point into our reality is quanta. Or to anthropomorphize: Infinity's interaction point with reality is quanta. Quanta is the point at which infinity becomes tangible or observable.
