Where does one even start with that which has no start? 

The official definitions on Google state:

> the state or quality of being infinite. 
or 
> a number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number (symbol âˆž).

I find both of these definitions to be lacking, not because they are wrong, but because Infinity is more than that.

Note that I tend to use the words 'True infinity' or 'infinity' instead of 'All that is' or 'reality', since both the latter terms tend to focus our attention on observably subsets of infinity and this reduces cognitive load, but increases likelyhood of making a mistake in assuming that realit is equal to infinity. Reality is subjective, not objective. It can only be objective if you could observe all of infinity, but since you can't - it is subjective.

## Definition

There are 2 main definitions I use:

* General infinity (or 'the larger infinity')
* Minor infinity 
    * or 'a subset infinity' 
    * or 'a subset of the larger infinity' - e.g. numbers, time
    * is a subset of general infinity
    * could be countable (but not necessarily)

### General Infinity, all that is, is:

General Infinity, all that is, is:

* That which is infinite, or more accurately, `that which is` (this includes `that which is not` since to `not be` means that you have to attempt observation of `that which is not`, which `is` a `that which is` - the observation itself `is`)
* It has no beginning, though it contains many beginnings. 
* It has no end, though it contains many ends
* All of our observable reality
* All of our unobservable reality
* All that is inside and outside our observable reality
* Inside itself
* Outside itself
* Has no origin, but its origin is in itself
* Has no end, but the end is in itself
* Can be negative, but not false (?)
* Contains all other subset infinities such as numbers, ranges

General infinity is not:

* A subset of anything
* A set that contains other sets. By claiming that it is a set, a boundary is imposed on it. This is a false premise imposing a boundary on that which has no boundary
* A number
* Describable - it cannot be defined. Assigning definition to it means that inifinity is captured. By definition this is impossible. If you could contain infinity, the set that contains it needs to be greater than infinity, which it cannot. Therefore, description of initinity is a subset of infinity, not the capturing of it. Ininity is not truly describable. We can attempt it, but not complete it.
* Countable. Yes, I agree, there are countable and uncountable infinities as subsets of the general infinity, but general inifinity itself is uncountable, because one is unable to find the first element which is the start. To count, to enumerate, to define, general infinity, means that you assert that you know the start of infinity. No one can make such a claim. And therefore we can only start at a subset of general infinity, but we cannot count general infinty itself.
