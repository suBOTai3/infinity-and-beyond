Where does one even start with that which has no start? 
This is an incredibly difficult and abstract concept since by definition, I'm trying to bring 'finite-ness' to that which defies finite observation.

The official definitions on Google states:

> the state or quality of being infinite. 

or 

> a number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number (symbol âˆž).

or

> `In` - not + `Finitus` - finished (Latin)

I find these definitions to be lacking, not because they are wrong, but because Infinity is more than that. While exploring the concept, different angles revealed more truth.


## Definition

There are 2 main concepts I propose:

* **General infinity** (or 'the larger infinity')
    * more below
* **Minor infinity** which is 
    * 'a subset of the larger infinity' - e.g. numbers, time
    * a subset of general infinity
    * may have a beginning, but has no end
    * more below

Note that I tend to use these terms 'General infinity' (GI) or 'infinity' instead of 'All that is' or 'reality', since both the latter terms tend to focus our attention on observably subsets of infinity and this reduces cognitive load, but increases likelyhood of making a mistake in assuming that reality (all that is within our sphere of observation) is equal to infinity. Reality is subjective, not objective (I aim to prove that ;)). 

See [reality](reality.md)

### General Infinity, all that is, all that exists:
 
General Infinity, all that is, is:

* All unions of all minor infinities and all non-infinite (finite) things (objects), concepts (thoughts) or future (time) or past (time) , or perhaps better, `that which is`.
* This includes `that which is not` since to `not be` means that you have to attempt observation of `that which is not`. This attempt `is` a `that which is`, which marks it as included in general infinity
* [Inclusive of beginnings and ends, General infinity](general_infinity/no-beginning-contains-itself.md) 
    * Has no beginning, though it contains all beginnings. 
    * Has no end, though it contains all ends
    * Has no origin, but its origin is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Has no end, but its end is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Has no boundaries, but the observable imposed boundaries is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Contains all other subset infinities such as numbers, ranges. 
* [Partially observable, General Infinity](observation/observation.md)    
    * Contains all of our observable reality
    * Contains all of unobservable reality
* Infinite in all directions
* Infinite in all dimensions
* Includes all dimensions of thought
* Inside that which is (anything inside anything else forms part of General Infinity, and therefore General Infinity has a 'stake' in everything)
* Outside that which is (When you get to the end of any subset infinity, or before the beginning of a subset infinity (e.g numbers), there is General Infinity)
* Can be negative, but not false (I wish there was a better way to phrase this. The concept here is that for something to be part of infinity, it must 'be'. Even if it is not extended in space or has no time associated to it. But to not have existence as a property means that it is 'not'. When it is 'false', it (the thing, thought or .?) is not negative or false. It has a beginning. It has an observational starting point. Anything (or thought or .?)with or without observational starting point forms part of General Infinity.This can include 'nothing', since 'nothing' is a concept, it is still part of general infinity, it just hasn't been observed yet and so its beginning hasn't been created. Hard to explain? Yes!?)
* Continually generative. [Observation](observation/observation.md) is the starting point (for us at least). more observation inside General drives the creation of more finite's and the creation of more minor infinities + generation of generation.
* Continually destructive.
* Choatic and ordered at the same time.
* Is not random, though it does include random (unknown origins) observational starting points for us
* The source or origin of all is
* The destination of all that is

  
<sup>**</sup> Yes it's confusing. But the same is true of a circle/sphere in a manner of speaking. This example is an oversimplification but more relatable and describable.

General infinity is not:

* A subset of anything
* A _set_ that contains other sets. By claiming that it is a set, a boundary is imposed on it. This is a false premise imposing a boundary on that which has no boundary
* Numerically expressable, because a number has boundaries
* Functionally expressable, because a function has a result or contains a boundary to the number of inputs it can take.
* Describable - it cannot be defined. Assigning definition to it means that inifinity is bouded. Captured. Narrowed. By definition the describability of GI is impossible. If you could contain GI, the set that contains it needs to be greater than infinity, which it cannot. Therefore, description of initinity is a subset of infinity, the capturing of it. The narrowing of it. GI is not truly describable. We can attempt it, but not complete it.
* Countable. Yes, I agree, there are countable and uncountable infinities as subsets of general infinity, but general inifinity itself is uncountable, because one is unable to find the first element which is the start. To count, to enumerate, to define, general infinity, means that you assert that you know the start of infinity. No one can make such a claim. And therefore we can only start at a subset of general infinity, but we cannot count general infinty itself. What you _can_ do is pretend you know the starting point, and start there.
* Segmentable. You cannot truly remove anything from general infinity. You can observe subsets of infinity, but not remove from it. To remove from GI you would have to somehow move the thing, the object, the .? you have outside of GI, which by definition is impossible. An oversimplified example would be to say I'd like to remove the number 1 from the set of infinite numbers. You can pretend to do it, but then how would you advance from 2 => 3? Where would you put 1? How would you add another decimal at the end of your number? How would you perform any addition? Any and all math stops working at that point. At that point you no longer have numbers. GI works similarly. You cannot remove anything because it's still in the 'set'. You can fantasize about removing it, but you cannot actually do it. If you were to remove it, the entire set would disappear. GI is more than that though - you cannot remove it from GI since by moving it somewhere else, it's still .. somewhere .. in some bounded context .. inside GI. You can't actually remove anything. In the section on [observation](observation/observation.md) there is more on this.
 
Examples:
* Whatever you can think of is part of GI ;)

## Minor infinity

A minor infinity is a subset of general infinity. It is generally what we observe and work with in our daily lives.

A minor infinity:

 * Could be countable (but doesn't have to be)
 * Could be observeable (but not necessarily)
 * Can be described, but not necessarily.
 * Has no beginning, but generally has an accepted starting point (e.g. we like to start our numbers at 0 or 1, but that is just a generalization, not a rule. We could start at 3 no? ;))
 * Has no end, but the set can be observed at a determined arbitrary starting point.
 * Has its origin in general infinity 
 * Has boundaries that originates in GI
 * Is a subset of GI (but crucially - it is not equal to GI)
 * Not segmentable (?): You cannot remove the number 1 from the set of numbers. If you did, how would you advance from 2 => 3? How would you have a coherent conversation? If you 'did' remove it, you're not removing the number itself, you're simply removing your representation of the number from your subset. (?)

Examples

* Points on a circle
* The numbers between 0 and 1
* Numbers in General
* Time
* The number of thoughts that's possible
