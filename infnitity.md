Where does one even start with that which has no start? 
This is an incredibly difficult and abstract concept since by definition, I'm trying to bring 'finite-ness' to that which defies finite observation.

The official definitions on Google state:

> the state or quality of being infinite. 

or 

> a number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number (symbol âˆž).

or

> `In` - not + `Finitus` - finished (Latin)

I find these definitions to be lacking, not because they are wrong, but because Infinity is more than that. While exploring the concept, different angles revealed more truth.


## Definition

There are 2 main definitions I use:

* General infinity (or 'the larger infinity')
    * more below
* Minor infinity 
    * or 'a subset infinity' 
    * or 'a subset of the larger infinity' - e.g. numbers, time
    * is a subset of general infinity
    * more below

Note that I tend to use the words 'General infinity' or 'infinity' instead of 'All that is' or 'reality', since both the latter terms tend to focus our attention on observably subsets of infinity and this reduces cognitive load, but increases likelyhood of making a mistake in assuming that realit is equal to infinity. Reality is subjective, not objective. It can only be objective if you could observe all of infinity, but since you can't - it is subjective.
See [reality](reality.md)

### General Infinity, all that is, all that exists:

General Infinity, all that is, is:

* That which is infinite, or perhaps better, `that which is` 
* This includes `that which is not` since to `not be` means that you have to attempt observation of `that which is not`. This attempt `is` a `that which is`
* [Inclusive of beginnings and ends](general_infinity/no-beginning-contains-itself.md) 
    * It has no beginning, though it contains many beginnings. 
    * It has no end, though it contains many ends
    * Has no origin, but its origin is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Has no end, but its end is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Has no boundaries, but the observable imposed boundaries is in itself - inside infinity <sup>**</sup>
    * Contains all other subset infinities such as numbers, ranges. 
* [Partially observable](observation/observation.md)    
    * All of our observable reality
    * All of unobservable reality
* All that is inside and outside our observable reality
* Infinite in all directions
* Inside that which is
* Outside that which is 
* Can be negative, but not false (?)
* Continually generative -> more observation inside GI drives more creation + generation
* Continually destructive
* Choatic and ordered
* The source of all is
* The destination of all that is
  
<sup>**</sup> Yes its confusing. But the same is true of a circle/sphere in a manner of speaking. This example is an oversimplification but more relatable and describable.

General infinity is not:

* A subset of anything
* A _set_ that contains other sets. By claiming that it is a set, a boundary is imposed on it. This is a false premise imposing a boundary on that which has no boundary
* Numerically expressable. A number has boundaries
* Describable - it cannot be defined. Assigning definition to it means that inifinity is captured. By definition this is impossible. If you could contain infinity, the set that contains it needs to be greater than infinity, which it cannot. Therefore, description of initinity is a subset of infinity, not the capturing of it. Ininity is not truly describable. We can attempt it, but not complete it.
* Countable. Yes, I agree, there are countable and uncountable infinities as subsets of general infinity, but general inifinity itself is uncountable, because one is unable to find the first element which is the start. To count, to enumerate, to define, general infinity, means that you assert that you know the start of infinity. No one can make such a claim. And therefore we can only start at a subset of general infinity, but we cannot count general infinty itself.
* Segmentable. You cannot truly remove anything from general infinity. You can observe subsets of infinity, but not remove from it. To remove from general infinity you would have to somehow move the thing you have outside of inifinity, which by definition is impossible.
 

## Minor infinity

A minor infinity is a subset of general infinity. It is generally what we observe and work with in our daily lives.

A minor infinity:

 * Could be countable (but doesn't have to be)
 * Could be observeable (but not necessarily)
 * Can be described
 * Has no beginning, but generally has an accepted starting poit
 * Has no end, but the set can be observed, so it has boundaries
 * Has its origin in general infinity 
 * Has boundaries that originates in general infinity
 * Is a subset of general infinity
 * Not segmentable (?): You cannot remove the number 1 from the set of numbers. If you did, how would you advance from 2 => 3? How would you have a coherent conversation? If you 'did' remove it, you're not removing the number itself, you're simply removing your representation of the number from your subset. (?)
