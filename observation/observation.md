# Observation

Observation is the act of subsetting a larger set.

## Example: An orange

When I look at an orange, I see the 'front' of the orange. I do not observe every molecule, every fibre, every juicy bit.

I'm reducing the total load of information to a set which is managable for my capacity as an observer.


What observation is:
* Taking a subset from a larger set, a chunk of data, and grouping it into a manageable chunk. E.g. my view of an orange is just that. A view. My view is not the orange itself. My view is only a representation of an orange. I am able to go into great detail, but I can never fully grasp the totality of an orange in one single instant. I can only work with subsets.

What observation is not:
* Taking the entire set from a larger set, and using it in its original form. E.g. my view of an orange is not the orange itself. It is a representation, a subset, of the larger set, but it is not _equal_ to the set.

## Example: Infinity

When I attempt to perceive infinity I'm unable to. I don't see all that is. I simply reduce it to a subset of manageble chunks of information.

What observation is:
* Taking a subset from a larger set, a chunk of data, and grouping it into a manageable chunk. E.g. my view of infinity is just that. A view. It is not infinity itself. It is only a representation of infinity. Another human. A table. A tree. An atom. I am able to go into great detail, but I can never fully grasp the totality of infinity in one single instant. I can only work with subsets.

What observation is not:
* Taking the entire set from a larger set, and using it in its original form. E.g. my view of infinity is not infinity itself. It is a representation, a subset, of the larger set, but it is not _equal_ to the set. I can look at 10 numbers, but not all numbers. I can look at a human, a table, a tree, but I cannot look at infinity. The only way to observe infinity is to be infinite one self.


## Takeaway

Observation is the act of subsetting.

If the context is an orange:
* We subset from the larger context, the reality that is an orange. 
* The orange itself is a subset of infinity
* I as a human am a subset of infinity

If the context is infinity
* We subset from the larger context, the reality that is infinity. 
* Infinity is not a subset of infinity
* I as a human am a subset of infinity
* I can only subset infinity using my capabilities, I cannot observe all of infinity
