# Observation

## Definition: 

> Observation is the act of forming a manageable [bounded context](readme.md#bounded-context) from a larger manageable or unmanagable[bounded](readme.md#bounded-context) or [unbounded](readme.md#unbounded-context)  context.

That's a mouth full, let's expand.

When an observer observes (imagine that!), the observer (conveniently named 'me' or 'I') creates manageable sets of information to work with from another set of data which is unmanageable. Let's start with our senses.

I look at {table|orange|.?|thing}. By looking, I'm:
* creating a subset from a larger set.
* taking a manageable chunk of visual data and using it for interpretation.
* using my sense of sight to reduce the amount of data to a manageable chunk.

I listen. By listening, I'm:
* creating a subset from a larger set.
* taking a manageable chunk of sound and using it for interpretation.
* using my sense of sound to reduce the amount of data to a manageable chunk.

## Example: An orange

When I look at an orange, I see the orange. However I do not see every molecule, every fibre, every juicy bit.

Using my sight, I'm reducing the total load of information to a visual data set which is managable for my capacity as an observer.

From this we can learn some things about observation.

What observation is:
* Taking a subset from a larger set, a chunk of data, and grouping it into a manageable chunk. E.g. my view of an orange is just that. A view. My view is not the orange itself. My view is only a representation of an orange. I am able to go into great detail by approaching it from different angles, stepping back, zooming in, etc., but I can never fully grasp the totality of an orange in one single instant. I can only work with subsets because my capacity as an observer is limited.

What observation is not:
* Taking the entire set from a larger set, and using it in its original form. E.g. my view of an orange is not the orange itself. It is a representation, a subset of the data, of the larger set, but it is not _equal_ to the set.

## Example: Infinity

When I attempt to perceive infinity I'm unable to. I don't see all that is. I simply reduce it to a subset of manageble chunks of information.

What observation is:
* Taking a subset from a larger set, a chunk of data, and grouping it into a manageable chunk. E.g. my view of infinity is just that. A view. It is not infinity itself. It is only a representation of infinity. Another human. A table. A tree. An atom. I am able to go into great detail, but I can never fully grasp the totality of infinity in one single instant. I can only work with subsets.A notable exception to this would be thoughts, specifically my own. Any thought I conjure, I have access to the entire set in one. I do not have a subset. However, in the future, when I'm trying to recall a dim memory, it is a subset.

What observation is not:
* Taking the entire set from a larger set, and using it in its original form. E.g. my view of infinity is not infinity itself. It is a representation, a subset, of the larger set, but it is not _equal_ to the set. I can look at 10 numbers, but not _all_ numbers. I can look at a human, a table, a tree, and see their extents. The boundaries. But I cannot look at infinity and observe the beginning _and_ the end _and_ everything inbetween. The only way to observe infinity is to be 
1. infinite one self in terms of capacity for observation or 
2. be the author of each element of the infinity and create all of them at the same time

Further expanding upon this:
* Being able to observe, to form a manageable subset or chunk, from infinity, does not mean that the subject matter (of the observation) does not exist outside our observation.
* The subject matter does exist, but it has not been grouped into a manageble chunk yet.
* Once the observation is made, once the unmanageable context is create, it exists for us.
* If the observation's subject matter is fantastical (hallucination), it still exists as a subset of the observer. The greater context here is the observer, which exists as a subset of infinity. In the larger context of infinity, this fantastical observation is a subset which is unobservable by any other observer, but it does exist for the author. It is important because the subset exists, even though it exists as unobservable to other observers. See also [unshareable observeable subsets](readme.md#unshareable-observable-subsets)

## Uniqueness of observation

The total sets of observations that I create
*  from my point of view
* within my limitations
* using the senses or tools at my disposal
* in the timeframe I live in
* in the coordinates I occupy
* grouped into a single set called 'me' or 'I'

Are unique to me. Other people may create similar, but importantly not _equal_, sets. The angle of definition, the temperature of light, my position in space. All these go into the definition of 'me' or 'I'. Based on our nature, last time I checked, humans are unable to occupy the space that another human or object has.

This means that each observation is unique to me. This means that all my observations, grouped together, make up 'me'. 

* 'I' am a collection of sensory inputs.
* 'I' am 'me', a collection of observations. 
* I am a 'collection of observations'. 
* I am a collection! (ready the tinfoil hat! Or should I say... we are a collection?!)
But importantly, I am a unique set of observations. No other person has a duplicate set. It may be close, but not the same.

## Takeaway

Observation is the act of subsetting.

If the context is an orange:

* I observe (subset) from the larger context, the context that is an orange. 
* The orange itself is a subset of infinity.
* At maximum capacity, I can observe (subset) some aspects of the orange, but not all, not at once.
* This is due to my limitations as a human observer.
* In theory a more powerful observer would be able to create a greater subset than that of mine.

If the context is infinity:

* I observe (subset) from the larger context, the context that is infinity. 
* Infinity is not a subset of infinity.
* I as a human am a subset of infinity.
* I can only subset infinity. 
* Using my capabilities, I cannot observe all of infinity.
